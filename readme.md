**Explain why the result of ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() is banana.**
> Answer: 
This is the result of type coercion and string concatenation.
Usually, When all the string are adding up wih '+' the result will still have type of sthing.
In this case, there is a gap where ' + + ' is used together with no value to add up, following by a string . This make it auttomatically convert the type NAN.
**'ba' + + 'a' is result in 'baNANa'**
then is being lowercased with the `toLowerCase()` which result in banana
